JAVA Half Day Assessment

MULTILEVEL APPROVAL for Maternity Leave:
The current implementation of the “Leave Management System” supports only one leave type: “Earned Leave”. We are going to support one more leave type: “Maternity Leave (ML)”.
If your leave type is ML – need approval from your Manager and HR Manager.
First level of approval goes to Manager and the Second level of approval goes to HR manger.

Needs to change the database design, Java logic and CLI.
Do the following changes in your project:- 
Employee and LeaveDetails table:
-	Add designation column in Employees table which contains Executive, Manager, 
HR Manager, CEO etc.
-	Add Maternity_Leave_status column in LeaveDetails table [PENDING/APPROVED/DENIED].
CLI changes:
-	Add option for HR Approval which has listing all pending ML status to approve or deny the request
Validation:
-	Only HR manager can approve all employee’s maternity leave except CEO.
-	HR manager can do only the second level of approval.

Note:
-	Applying / Approving maternity leave for HR manager and CEO is out of scope.
